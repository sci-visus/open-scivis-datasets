    "description": "Volumes were obtained by way of computed tomography (CT) imaging on excised, postmortem porcine hearts. Alginate curing agents were injected into ventricles to provide rigidity and radiopaque agents were injected into the coronary arteries to distinguish microvasculature from the rest of the tissue.",
